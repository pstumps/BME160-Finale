# DendroHeatmap

Created by Patrick and Malav

DendroHeat.py creates a visualization of an interactive heatmap and dendrogram using libraries from both Bokeh and MatPlotLib.
This program will cluster a user provided distance matrix using matplotlib to create a dendrogram in parallel with a heatmap using Bokeh. Creation of the heatmap allows efficient visualization of any trends that may be correlated with the users clustering data and has a wide array of applications including determining gene expression to releative membrance permeability of cyclic peptides. 

Usage of this program is as follows:

Input: DendroHeat.py [heatmap data].xlsx [distancematrix].xlsx

Output: HTML file of Heatmap with dendrogram.
